# Then, we're going to sort the bam files, remove the PCR duplicates, and index them

# First, let's covert sam to bam; then we sort

for f in ${output}/BWA/${mypop}*.sam

do 

  out=${f/.sam/}
  sambamba-0.7.1-linux-static view -S --format=bam ${f} -o ${out}.bam

for file in ${output}/BWA/${mypop}*.sorted.bam

do

#  Now to finish, we'll index our files
